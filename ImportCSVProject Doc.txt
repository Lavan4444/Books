IMPORT CSV PROJECT - BUSINESS DOCUMENTATION
==========================================

1. BUSINESS PURPOSE
-------------------
The Import CSV Project component serves as a comprehensive project data import and management system that enables organizations to efficiently bulk-load project information from external data sources including spreadsheets, CSV files, and Excel documents. This critical business tool streamlines the setup and onboarding of project portfolios, enabling rapid system implementation and seamless migration from legacy project management platforms.

The component functions as a strategic project data integration platform that transforms external project documentation and information systems into standardized PMS project structures. This capability is essential for organizations implementing new project management systems, consolidating multiple project databases, migrating from legacy platforms, or establishing standardized project management practices across diverse business units and geographic locations.

The system supports business efficiency by automating the traditionally manual and time-intensive process of project setup while ensuring data quality, duplicate detection, and validation processes that maintain the integrity of project information essential for accurate tracking, resource allocation, and strategic planning across the entire project portfolio.
