IMPORT CSV CONTACTS - BUSINESS DOCUMENTATION
============================================

1. BUSINESS PURPOSE
-------------------
The Import CSV Contacts component serves as a comprehensive contact management and data integration system that enables organizations to efficiently bulk-load contact information from external data sources including spreadsheets, CSV files, and Excel documents. This critical business tool streamlines the establishment and maintenance of professional contact databases, enabling rapid customer relationship management system implementation and seamless migration from legacy contact management platforms.
