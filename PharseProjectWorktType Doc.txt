PARSE PROJECT WORK TYPE - BUSINESS DOCUMENTATION
===============================================

1. BUSINESS PURPOSE
-------------------
The Parse Project Work Type component serves as a comprehensive document processing and data extraction system that enables organizations to automatically convert unstructured project documentation into structured project and task data within the Project Management System (PMS). This critical business tool streamlines the onboarding of existing project information, reduces manual data entry overhead, and ensures consistent data structure across all project management activities.

The component functions as an intelligent document processing pipeline that transforms external project documentation, spreadsheets, and data files into standardized project records and work type classifications. This capability is essential for organizations migrating from legacy systems, consolidating project data from multiple sources, or implementing standardized project management practices across diverse business units.

The system supports business efficiency by automating the traditionally time-intensive process of manual project data entry while ensuring data quality and consistency through structured validation and review processes before final system integration.

2. APPLICATION WORKFLOW INTEGRATION
