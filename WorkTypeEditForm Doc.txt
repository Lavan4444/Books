WORK TYPE EDIT FORM - BUSINESS & FUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTATION
=========================================================

Task receipt & plan
-------------------
I will produce a concise, client-friendly, non-technical description of the `WorkTypeEditForm` component that explains its business purpose, where it sits in workflows, what data it handles, all user interactions, the visible controls and options, and how it supports business decisions. The document will be saved as `WorkTypeEditForm Doc.txt` in the project root.

Requirements checklist
----------------------
- [x] Business purpose of component
- [x] How it fits into application workflow
- [x] Data displayed and processed
- [x] All user interactions described
- [x] Dropdowns, filters, buttons, inputs listed with purpose and typical options
- [x] Business impact and decision-support description

1. Business purpose
-------------------
The Work Type Edit Form is the central business interface for creating and maintaining individual work types (tasks, sub-tasks, bugs, stories, etc.) used across projects. It standardizes how activities are described, staffed, scheduled and approved so that delivery teams, project managers and stakeholders share a common vocabulary and governance for work execution.

In practice this form captures the operational definition of a unit of work: what it is, which project and module it belongs to, who is watching or responsible, expected effort and dates, priority and approval state. That consistent definition enables accurate tracking, costing, reporting and cross-team coordination.

2. How it fits into the overall application workflow
---------------------------------------------------
- Entry point for creating or editing a Work Type that will be used when creating tasks within projects.
- Changes here affect task creation, planning, workload estimates, and downstream reporting.
- Acts upstream of assignment and execution modules (task boards, time tracking, estimations) and feeds audit and approval processes.
- Typical flow: product/PM updates or creates a work type → teams use it for task creation and time entry → managers use aggregated status/priority for portfolio decisions.

3. What data it displays or processes
-------------------------------------
The form presents and edits key attributes of a work item:
- Project linkage: which project the work type belongs to (project selector).
- Module: functional area within the project (module selector).
- Watchers: users who receive updates about this work item.
- Work Type identity: an internal code/name for the work type and its parent work type.
- Summary/Description: short textual summary and longer description (rich text) of the work to be performed.
- Timeline & effort: estimated work hours, planned start date, due date, and actual completion date.
- Status: lifecycle state of the work type (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Cancelled).
- Priority: business urgency (High, Medium, Low) and related sub-states.
- Approval status: Approved, Rejected, Pending – used in gating workflows.
- Documents: associated artifacts (requirements, specs, test-plans, deployment guides) with subject and file attachment.
- System fields: create/edit timestamps and creators/editors for auditability.
- Privacy settings: option to mark the work type private and restrict visibility to selected users.

4. All user interactions possible within this component
------------------------------------------------------
- Choose or change the Project context for the work type.
- Select the Module to which the work belongs (or add/edit modules where allowed).
- Assign one or more Watchers to monitor progress.
- Choose the specific Work Type variant and Parent Work Type (to establish hierarchy).
- Enter a summary and rich-text description; use the AI helper (UI button) to draft or enhance text.
- Set or update timeline fields: estimated work hours, start date, due date, and actual completion date.
- Set Status and Priority values that drive rules and reporting.
- Set Approval status used for gating or publishing the work type.
- Attach project documents through an Add Document dialog: choose type (from grouped categories), provide a subject and upload a file.
- Toggle Private and choose specific users who will have access when privacy is enabled.
- Save changes (Save) or discard them (Cancel) — both actions provide user feedback.

5. Dropdowns, filters, buttons, and input fields (purpose & common options)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Cancel (secondary): discards changes and returns to the work type list.
- Add Document (within dialog): saves a document entry and attaches the file to the work type.

6. How this component supports business goals and decision-making
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Operational efficiencies
- Standardizes how work is defined across projects, reducing ambiguity and rework during execution.
- Embedded effort and schedule estimates feed resource planning and capacity management.

Governance & compliance
- Approval status and system audit fields enable controlled publishing of work types and provide traceability for audits and client reviews.

Prioritization & risk management
- Priority and status fields enable portfolio managers and PMO to filter and escalate critical items, improving focus on high-impact work.

Collaboration & knowledge retention
- Documents, watchers, and rich notes create a single context-rich record of the work item—useful for handoffs, reviews and onboarding.

Reporting & strategic decisions
- Structured fields (project, module, status, priority, dates) become consistent metrics for dashboards and BI—supporting decisions like staffing, backlog prioritization, and release planning.

Security & confidentiality
- Per-item privacy controls allow sensitive work to be shielded and only shared with named individuals, supporting NDAs and internal confidentiality requirements.

Typical business scenarios where this form adds value
- Defining a new deliverable within a larger project and ensuring it has clear scope, timeline and owner.
- Creating a high-priority bug or hotfix with immediate watchers and clear approval gating.
- Recording a complex task with attachments (specs, test plans) so developers and QA have the exact context.
- Marking sensitive tasks as private to restrict access to approved personnel.
